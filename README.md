# 🚀 **Project Title: Kuda Customer Intelligence Hub: A Full-Funnel Growth & Segmentation Simulation**

## 🎯 **Project Objective:**

This project simulates a real-world data analyst role at **Kuda**, a digital-only bank, by building a **full-funnel analytics pipeline**. The system tracks the **entire user journey from marketing to retention, integrates data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and dashboarding**, calculates key business metrics (e.g., **Churn, CAC, LTV, MoM/YoY Growth**), and simulates **A/B testing** for product/CRM strategies to support the Growth, CRM, and Product teams.

The end goal is to provide a **dashboard and reporting suite** that empowers executive teams to make data-driven decisions—**all while showcasing the real challenges fintechs face in aligning growth with product performance**, and most importantly, enabling **personalized strategies through a dynamic customer segmentation framework, designed to maximize user value and minimize churn.**

* Are we **overpaying** to acquire **low-LTV users**?

#### 📌 **Funnel Conversion Rates**

* What percentage of users move from:
    * **Signup → Activation?**
    * **Activation → First Transaction?**
    * **First Transaction → Retention?**

#### 📌 **CRM Campaign ROI**

* What’s the **retention uplift** from email/push campaigns?
* Does **A/B testing** show a statistically significant impact?
* What’s the **ROI** on our CRM automation tools?

#### 📌 **Growth Metrics**

* What’s our **Month-on-Month (MoM)** and **Year-on-Year (YoY)** user growth?
* How are **campaign spend and signups trending** over time?

#### 📌 **Customer Segmentation & Personalization**

* Can we **cluster users** based on behavioral or transactional patterns?
* Which segments have the **highest LTV, lowest churn, or strongest growth**?
* Are we able to **personalize marketing/CRM strategies** based on these segments?
* What are the demographics and behaviors of our **most loyal customers**?

## 🧠 Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### **PHASE 1: Simulate and Prepare Data**

Use Python to simulate:

* **CRM Data (HubSpot style)**: user\_id, email, signup\_date, utm\_source, campaign
* **App Events (Amplitude style)**: event\_type, user\_id, timestamp
* **Transaction Records**: transaction\_id, user\_id, amount, date
* **Campaign Spend Data**: campaign\_id, platform, cost, impressions, signups

👉 Tools: `Faker`, `random`, `pandas`

---

### **PHASE 2: Load to SQL & Integrate**

* Load data into **Snowflake** (Kuda stack) or **PostgreSQL** (for simulation)
* Create SQL views and joins: users × events × transactions × campaigns
* Write SQL scripts to:
    * Track **signup → activation → retention**
    * Link **campaign → CRM user → LTV**

👉 Tools: `Snowflake Connector`, `SQLAlchemy`, `psycopg2`

---

### **PHASE 3: Business Metrics Calculation**

Using Pandas and SQL:

* Cohort-based **Retention Tables**
* **Churn rate**, **CAC**, **LTV**
* **MoM Growth**, **YoY Growth**
* **Campaign ROI**

👉 Tools: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, SQL (Snowflake)

---

### **PHASE 4: Funnel + Retention Analysis**

* Define funnel stages: Visit → Signup → Activate → Retain
* Calculate:
    * Drop-off rates
    * Conversion rates
    * Retention curves

👉 Tools: Python + SQL → `Plotly`, `matplotlib`, `Snowflake` queries

---

### **PHASE 5: Customer Segmentation & Clustering**

Use unsupervised learning to:

* **Group users by behavioral traits**:
    * Transaction frequency & recency (RFM)
    * LTV (or proxy for value)
    * Engagement (e.g., app logins, feature usage, KYC completion)
    * Campaign interaction
* **Apply clustering techniques**: KMeans, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering (potentially after dimensionality reduction with PCA).
* **Profile segments**: Create detailed profiles for each cluster, describing their unique characteristics, needs, and behaviors.
* **Label segments**: Assign descriptive names (e.g., “High-Value Transactors,” “Churn Risk - Low Engagement,” “New User Explorers”).
* **Build a Customer DNA Matrix**: Visualize segments using a quadrant system (e.g., X-axis: LTV, Y-axis: Engagement). This will highlight:
    * **💎 Power Users (High LTV, High Engagement)**
    * **👑 Quiet Whales (High LTV, Low Engagement)**
    * **🐝 Active Explorers (Low LTV, High Engagement)**
    * **💤 Churn Risks (Low LTV, Low Engagement)**

👉 Tools: `Scikit-learn` (KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA), `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`
**Output**: Segment labels for each user, detailed segment profiles, and the Customer DNA Matrix visualization. These will enhance dashboards, guide CRM personalization, and inform A/B testing splits.

---

### **PHASE 6: Personalization Recommendation Output**

Develop a module that, given a customer segment, recommends specific personalization strategies. This acts as the "action layer" of your segmentation.

```python
# Pseudo-code for personalization_recommendations.py
def recommend_personalization(segment):
    """
    Provides tailored recommendations based on the customer segment.
    """
    if segment == "Power Users":
        return "Upsell Premium Tier + Referral Rewards Program"
    elif segment == "Quiet Whales":
        return "Reactivation Campaign (targeted SMS/Email) + Personalized Financial Advisory Tips"
    elif segment == "Active Explorers":
        return "Product Tour (new features) + Gamified Engagement Challenges"
    elif segment == "Churn Risks":
        return "Exclusive Discount Coupon + Nudge to Complete KYC/First Transaction"
    else:
        return "Standard communication"

# This output can be integrated with a simulated CRM system or used for A/B test design.
```

👉 Tools: `Python`, `Pandas`
**Output**: Actionable recommendations linked to each customer segment.

---

### **PHASE 7: A/B Testing**

Simulate:

* Test different retention emails or app features, now **tailored to specific customer segments**, informed by the personalization recommendations.
* Compare performance between a **control group** (no personalized treatment) and **test groups** (segmented and personalized treatment).
* Analyze click-through, conversion, and retention over 7 days, broken down **by segment**, to validate the effectiveness of tailored strategies.

👉 Tools: `scipy.stats`, `statsmodels`, `pandas`, SQL

---

### **PHASE 8: Visual Dashboards**

* Build an executive-style dashboard with:
    * **Retention curves (now potentially by segment)**
    * CAC vs LTV (with insights on **segment-specific LTV**)
    * MoM/YoY growth
    * Campaign ROI (highlighting **segment-specific campaign effectiveness**)
    * Funnel conversion (identifying **segment drop-off points**)
    * **Customer Segment overview** (size, key characteristics, and performance of each segment)
    * **Customer DNA Matrix visualization** for strategic overview.

👉 Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Snowflake connector

---

### **PHASE 9: Reporting & Documentation**

* **Executive Summary (TL;DR.md)**: A concise, high-level summary for leadership, answering:
    * What are our 3 biggest growth opportunities?
    * Which segment has the highest ROI potential?
    * What should we stop spending money on?
    * *This will synthesize insights from all phases, especially segmentation and A/B testing.*
* Detailed Final Report (PDF/Markdown)
* Dashboard walkthrough (screenshots and live link)
* SQL + Python codebase with comments
* Data dictionary + project walkthrough
* **Dedicated section on customer segments, their actionable insights, and personalization strategies.**

👉 Tools: Markdown, Google Docs, Canva (for styling)

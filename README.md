# 🚀 **Project Title: Kuda Full-Funnel Growth Analytics/Intelligence System (KUDA Simulation)**

## 🎯 **Project Objective:**

This project simulates a real-world data analyst role at **Kuda**, a digital-only bank, by building a **full-funnel analytics pipeline**. The system tracks the **entire user journey from marketing to retention, integrates data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and dashboarding ** , calculates key business metrics (e.g., **Churn, CAC, LTV, MoM/YoY Growth**), and simulates **A/B testing** for product/CRM strategies to support the Growth, CRM, and Product teams.

The end goal is to provide a **dashboard and reporting suite** that empowers executive teams to make data-driven decisions—**all while showcasing the real challenges fintechs face in aligning growth with product performance**.

## 🧠 Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### **PHASE 1: Simulate and Prepare Data**

Use Python to simulate:

* **CRM Data (HubSpot style)**: user\_id, email, signup\_date, utm\_source, campaign
* **App Events (Amplitude style)**: event\_type, user\_id, timestamp
* **Transaction Records**: transaction\_id, user\_id, amount, date

👉 Tools: `Faker`, `random`, `pandas`

---

### **PHASE 2: Load to SQL & Integrate**

* Load data into **Snowflake** (Kuda stack) or **PostgreSQL** (for simulation)
* Create SQL views and joins: users × events × transactions × campaigns
